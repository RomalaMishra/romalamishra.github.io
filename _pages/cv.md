# Work experience

- Perception and Recognition via Imaging and Sensing using Modern-AI (PRISM) Research Group, NIT Rourkela, 2024-2025: Undergraduate Research Assistant

  - Advisor: [Dr. Sobhan Kanti Dhara](https://nitrkl.ac.in/FacultyStaff/FacultyProfile/dharask)
    - Developed an encoder-decoder based framework to restore image degradations caused by haze and
sand-dust for improving object detection and classification performance.
    - Incorporated selective attention mechanisms to emphasize relevant features while reducing computation.

- Machine Intelligence and Bio-motion Lab, NIT Rourkela, 2024: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  - Advisor: [Dr. Anup Nandy](https://nitrkl.ac.in/FacultyStaff/FacultyProfile/nandya)
    - Implemented a DRL-based navigation pipeline using the TD3 algorithm and laser scan inputs to enable decision-making in dynamic environments, and deployed it on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, balancing inference speed with performance constraints.
    - Developed a SLAM-based indoor navigation and exploration framework, focusing on static environments using LiDAR data and spatial mapping techniques.
    - Designed a transformer-based architecture for speech emotion recognition, combining acoustic features (pitch, tone) with transcript-based textual cues to support emotionally aware human-robot communication in multimodal settings. 

- Barclays, Summer 2024: Global Security Developer Intern
  - Manager: [Atul Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atul-mishra-9b06a42/)
    - Enhanced system efficiency by reducing synchronization time by a factor of 8 through parallel processing and
dynamic server retrieval using server aliases.
    - Automated job scheduling with Autosys integration, eliminating manual intervention and improving reliability.

- Computer Vision Lab, IIT Kharagpur, Summer 2023: Research Intern
  - Advisor: [Prof. Aurobindo Routray](https://iitkgp.ac.in/department/EE/faculty/ee-aroutray)
    - Developed a hybrid CNN–Transformer model for robust face detection and recognition in video sequences, with a focus on handling motion blur and partial occlusion.
